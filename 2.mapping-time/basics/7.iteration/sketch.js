/*
   Iteration with a "for" loop to construct repetitive forms.

   loop syntax works like this:
     for(initialize; test; update){
       ... loop body (i.e., the steps to be repeated)
     }
     ... rest of program

   the basic flow of this kind of loop is:
     1. do the 'initialize' operation
     2. is 'test' true? YES: execute the statements in the 'body' of the loop
                        NO: 'break' from looping and move on to the rest of the program
     3. do the 'update' operation
     4. go to step 2

   Updating a variable by modifying its existing value is extremely common when looping.
   Some convenient shorthands for this include:
     x++     is equivalent to:  x = x + 1
     x--     is equivalent to:  x = x - 1
     x += a  is equivalent to:  x = x + a
     x -= b  is equivalent to:  x = x + b
     x *= c  is equivalent to:  x = x * c
     x /= c  is equivalent to:  x = x / c
